# REALTIME-CHAT-APP
A real-time Python chat app using Flask and Socket.IO. Users get random usernames and avatars, can send messages, and update their usernames. Clean UI with avatar support, system notifications, and live chat broadcasting. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python backend.
I deployed my web service on Render, a cloud platform that simplifies app hosting.

The service auto-deploys from my GitHub repository whenever I push updates.
HTTPS is enabled by default, ensuring secure communication.
Environment variables and background tasks are managed via Renderâ€™s dashboard.
